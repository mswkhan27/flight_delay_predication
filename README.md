# flight_delay_predication

Developed a model aimed at predicting flight delays at take-of.

Steps:-

Read Flight and Airline Data
Convert time in standard format
Convert Cancellation Reason column to Numeric Values for our own ease.
Convert Nan to numeric 0
Added a new Column for Delayed Status True or False just for more clarity
Merged the Airline Names with the Flights csv file for our own benefit.
Predict the Flight Delays using Random Forest Regression
Train, Validate and then Test with random datasets.
Visualize the Data by viewing different reasons of Delay

a. Which Airline had more delays.

b. Which Feature Value was most important in Regression Modelling.

c. Graphs between Actual and Predicted Values
